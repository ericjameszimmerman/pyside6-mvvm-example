# pyside6-mvvm-example

The following example is a simple application to demonstrate Model-View-ViewModel pattern in python and as a playground for developing views.

It is easy to find simple applications where everything is shoved in a single file, but for medium-to-large applications, that structure quickly becomes unmaintainable.

There are some sporadic examples of MVC, MVP and MVVM on the internet, but nothing large enough to really identify the best practice, so this project is an attempt to try it out.

## Why PySide6?

- PyQt6 is suitable if you are looking for a mature, feature-rich binding with extensive documentation and don't mind the licensing requirements.
- PySide6 is a good choice if you need a more permissive license and prefer the backing and support of The Qt Company.

## Licensing

- PyQt6: PyQt is available under the GPL and a commercial license. If you are using it for a closed-source project, you will need to purchase a commercial license.
- PySide6: PySide is available under the LGPL, which is more permissive. This allows you to use it in both open-source and closed-source projects without needing to purchase a commercial license.
